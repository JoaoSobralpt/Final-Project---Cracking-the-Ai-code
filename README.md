Final-Project---Cracking-the-Ai-code
This is my Ironhack bootcamp Final project, focused on AI tools: Analyzing trending tools, categories, upcoming trends, and building 2 recommenders for AI tools.

Cracking the AI Code: Deciphering the Secrets of Artificial Intelligence tools
Welcome to "Cracking the AI Code: Deciphering the Secrets of Artificial Intelligence tools", my comprehensive project from Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp that delves into the world of AI, data analysis, and fun AI-themed games!

Project Overview
This project is my journey through the realms of data analysis, AI tools, and entertaining AI-themed games. I covered various aspects, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Plus, get ready to participate in the AI-lympics, a quiz game that tests your AI knowledge and offers exciting titles as prizes!

Key Components
1. Data Collection
Datasets from Kaggle: I gathered three distinct datasets from Kaggle to serve as the foundation for my analysis. These datasets contain valuable information related to AI and data.
Web Scraping with Synthesia: In addition to Kaggle datasets, I utilized web scraping techniques to collect data from Synthesia, expanding my dataset with real-world information.
2. Data Cleaning & Analysis
Data Cleaning: My first step was to ensure that the collected data was clean and ready for analysis. I tackled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to create a robust dataset.
Data Analysis: I employed various data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights, including data summarization, aggregation, and visualization.
3. Data Visualization
Visual Insights: To make data more digestible and engaging, I created a range of visualizations, such as bar charts, scatter plots, word clouds, and stacked bar charts. These visuals offer a deeper understanding of the AI landscape. (created through Tableau)
4. AI-lympics: The Ultimate Data Battle
Game Name: AI-lympics: The Ultimate Data Battle
Game Description: AI-lympics is an interactive quiz game that challenges participants with multiple-choice questions about AI tools. Earn points for each correct answer and compete for coveted titles!
Game Rules: Detailed rules are provided within the game.
5. AI Tool Recommenders
AI Tool Recommender (Actual Tools): I developed an AI tool recommender that suggests AI tools based on user preferences on categories and upvotes. It helps users discover the most popular AI tools.
AI Tool Recommender (Future Tools): My second recommender extends beyond existing tools, offering insights into future AI tools in development.
